* About CC
- Since you are going to see us quite a lot in the next weeked:
   I'll not speak about our competences as engineers, or character, or attitude towards our work and between us. That should be an info that you take from these lectures.
- CC has always been a place where:
  1. A lot of experimentation happens.
  2. Where passionate engineers discuss, share and evaluate interesting ideas.
  3. OSS is a core value, and we contribute to many projects either with bugfixes or active contributors.
  4. Every engineer has the right context to evolve and build her/his carreer following their passion.
  5. Our pride lays in what we produce. When it goes in the wild we make sure it is pitch perfect.

** Some stats
   - Out of 9 active projects:
      4 are World No.1 in their respective industries

   - No 1. Conmpany by retention rate.
      Have 1 person left in the last 6 years

   - With only ~50 engineers, we cover a lot of ground:

- Ryan Dahl, had an idea
- And proved that most of the world can run on a "signle thread".
*** Why people are so lured towards node?
  - Fast startup
  - Simple
  - Lots of people know js
  - js is forgiving(this is not good).

** Setup
- node
  the vm itself
  https://nodejs.org/en/
- nvm
  when you need multiple versions of node , this is the tool to go
  https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- nodemon
  restarts a program when a file changes
  https://github.com/remy/nodemon/
** Hello world
** Something real
*** Package management - NPM
*** Module system
*** IO library, how it works
*** NodeJs process
